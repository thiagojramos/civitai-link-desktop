## FAQ

### What the Civitai Link Key? Where do I get it?

The Civitai Link Key is a short 6 character token that you'll receive when setting up your Civitai Link instance (you can see it referenced here in this [Civitai Link installation video](https://civitai.com/v/civitai-link-installation)). The Link Key acts as a temporary secret key to connect your Stable Diffusion instance to your Civitai Account inside our link service.

Since Civitai Link is still in alpha, it is currently only available to Supporters as part of the Civitai Early Access program. You can get access to Civitai Link today by [becoming a supporter](https://civitai.com/pricing) ðŸ¥° or you can wait until we've gotten it to a state that we're ready for a full release.
